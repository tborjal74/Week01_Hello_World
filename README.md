# Overview

Hi! I'm about to start to learn Java Programming and I'm excited to show what I have learned so far.

The software that I created displays a text that says Hello World.

I created this software for the purpose of demonstrating my basic knowledge and application of the Java programming language.

# Development Environment

I downloaded the Eclipse IDE since I determined through my research that is the most recommended platform to work on Java project. I also used GitHub to connect my repository to my project in Eclipse.
I used the Java Programming language.
